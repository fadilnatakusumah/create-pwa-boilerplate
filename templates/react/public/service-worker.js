// This file is a placeholder. 
// 
// The actual Service Worker logic is generated and injected by the 
// 'vite-plugin-pwa' (using Workbox) during the Vite build process 
// (npm run build).
//
// The PWA plugin will automatically create a worker that handles
// pre-caching of all static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
